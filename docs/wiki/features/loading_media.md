# Feature: Loading Media

FrameTamer supports multiple ways to bring your artwork into the studio.

## 1. Import Photo
Standard local file picker for JPEG, PNG, and TIFF formats.

## 2. Google Photos
Direct integration with your Google Photos library. 

## 3. Frame Texture Extraction
One of FrameTamer's most powerful features. You can take a photo of a real-world frame and "Extract" the texture to use as a virtual frame in the app.
