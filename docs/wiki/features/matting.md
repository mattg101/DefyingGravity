# Feature: Matting & Mounting

FrameTamer supports professional matting strategies.

## 1. Float Mount
Artwork is centered on a backing board, often with a "shadow" effect. FrameTamer calculates the precise backing board size.

## 2. Overmat
A traditional window mat that covers the edges of the artwork.

## 3. Mat Borders
You can set top, bottom, left, and right borders independently. Use the "Link" button to keep them symmetrical.
