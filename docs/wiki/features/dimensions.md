# Feature: Dimensions & Profiles

Accurate measurements are the foundation of FrameTamer. 

## 1. Frame Aperture
This is the **visible opening** of your frame. Enter the Width and Height of the glass or opening.

## 2. Frame Profile
*   **Face Width**: The width of the frame material visible from the front.
*   **Rabbet Depth**: The depth of the channel that holds the glass, art, and backing.

FrameTamer uses these to calculate exactly how much the frame overlaps your artwork.
